# Mywebsite
#### **Portfolio Website**

- Inspired by a YouTube tutorial [Click-Here](https://youtu.be/moRqo158NGc)and enhanced with my own **prompt engineering skills**, I created this portfolio site with some custom tinkering.  
- Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**  no frameworks, just pure front-end code.  
- The main reason I built this project was to **refresh my HTML and JavaScript reading skills**. I’m not a front-end developer, but I wanted to challenge myself and share the result.  
- While I don’t recommend “vibe coding” for backend work, this project shows that even as a backend or security-focused developer, you can **leverage AI tools to generate clean, functional code**.  
- With a solid understanding of **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**, you can easily customize AI-generated templates to suit your own needs.
